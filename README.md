# CardGame
An in-progress exercise creating a card game

The idea is a flexible card game engine if you will. Initial idea is to get it to play a Yu-gi-oh style card game with some basic game phases, cards with different effects, etc.
However the goal is to also make it flexible with things like card effects, player actions, the game phases, and other things so it could be different kinds of card games.
